Parallelism: The fundamental concept of HPC. It involves performing multiple computations simultaneously to solve a problem faster. This can be achieved through various techniques.
Concurrency: Managing and executing multiple tasks seemingly at the same time. These tasks might not be executing truly simultaneously on different processors but are rapidly switching, giving the illusion of parallelism.
Amdahl's Law: A crucial concept that highlights the limitations of parallelization. It states that the speedup achievable by parallelizing an application is limited by the sequential portion of the code. If a fraction 'S' of the execution time is inherently sequential, the maximum speedup achievable with 'P' processors is:
Speedup≤ 
S+ 
P
1−S
​
 
1
​
 
This tells us that even with a large number of processors, the speedup plateaus if there's a significant sequential part.
Scalability: The ability of a parallel program to maintain its efficiency as the number of processors and the problem size increase. A highly scalable program can effectively utilize more resources to solve larger problems in a reasonable time.
Overhead: The extra time and resources required to manage and coordinate parallel tasks. This includes communication between processors, synchronization, and the creation/management of threads or processes. The goal of parallelization is to have the benefits outweigh the overhead.
1. Parallel Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) using OpenMP
Theory:

Breadth-First Search (BFS): Traverses a graph level by level. It starts at a source node and explores all its neighbors at the current depth before moving to the nodes at the next depth level. It typically uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit.
Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It starts at a source node and explores one of its neighbors, then a neighbor of that neighbor, and so on, until it reaches a node with no unvisited neighbors. It typically uses a stack (implicitly through recursion or explicitly).
OpenMP: An Application Programming Interface (API) that supports multi-platform shared-memory parallel programming in C, C++, and Fortran. It consists of a set of compiler directives, library routines, and environment variables that influence run-time behavior. The core idea is to use compiler directives to tell the compiler which parts of your code can be executed in parallel across multiple threads.   
Parallelizing BFS:

The main challenge in parallelizing BFS lies in processing the nodes at the current level concurrently.

Level-by-Level Parallelism: The outer loop iterating through the levels can be parallelized. However, you need to be careful about managing the next level's nodes and avoiding race conditions when marking nodes as visited.
Processing Neighbors in Parallel: For each node at the current level, the process of exploring its unvisited neighbors can be parallelized. You'll need synchronization mechanisms (like atomic operations or critical sections) to ensure that nodes are marked as visited correctly and added to the queue for the next level without conflicts.
Parallelizing DFS:

Parallelizing DFS is generally more complex due to its inherently recursive and sequential nature of exploring deeply along a path.

Task Parallelism: One approach is to explore different branches of the graph in parallel. When a node has multiple unvisited neighbors, you can create separate tasks (using OpenMP's task directive) to explore each of these branches concurrently.
Careful with Shared State: You need to be very careful about shared data structures like the visited array/set to avoid race conditions. Proper synchronization mechanisms are crucial.
Basic OpenMP Constructs You'll Likely Use:

#pragma omp parallel: Creates a team of threads.
#pragma omp for: Distributes loop iterations across the threads in the team. Suitable for parallelizing the processing of nodes at a level in BFS.
#pragma omp single: Executes a block of code by only one thread in the team. Useful for initializing data structures or managing the transition to the next level in BFS.
#pragma omp critical: Restricts access to a block of code to only one thread at a time. Can be used for updating shared data structures, but overuse can limit performance.
#pragma omp atomic: Ensures that a specific memory location is updated atomically, preventing race conditions for simple operations like marking a node as visited.
#pragma omp task and #pragma omp taskwait: Create and wait for the completion of parallel tasks, useful for parallelizing branches in DFS.
2. Parallel Bubble Sort and Merge Sort using OpenMP
Theory:

Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It's generally inefficient for large datasets due to its O(n 
2
 ) time complexity.   
Merge Sort: A more efficient divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves. It has a time complexity of O(nlogn).   
Sequential Performance Measurement: You'll need to record the execution time of the sequential versions of these algorithms for the same input size to have a baseline for comparison. Standard timing functions in your programming language can be used for this.
Parallel Performance Measurement: Similarly, record the execution time of the parallel versions. You'll likely want to experiment with different numbers of threads to see how the performance scales.
Parallelizing Bubble Sort:

Directly parallelizing the outer loop of bubble sort is tricky because each pass depends on the previous one. However, some optimizations can be done:

Odd-Even Sort (a parallel variant of bubble sort): This algorithm performs comparisons and swaps in two phases: the odd phase and the even phase. In each phase, independent comparisons can be performed in parallel.
Parallelizing Merge Sort:

Merge sort lends itself well to parallelization due to its divide-and-conquer nature:

Parallel Recursive Calls: The recursive calls to sort the two halves of the array can be executed in parallel using OpenMP's task directive. You'll need a base case for the recursion (when the subarray size is small enough that the overhead of creating a new task outweighs the benefit).
Parallel Merging (more complex): The merging step itself can also be parallelized, but it's more involved and often not the primary bottleneck for moderate input sizes.
Basic OpenMP Constructs You'll Likely Use:

#pragma omp parallel: To create a team of threads for the parallel regions.
#pragma omp single: To ensure that the initial division of the array happens only once.
#pragma omp task and #pragma omp taskwait: To create parallel tasks for the recursive sorting of subarrays in merge sort.
omp_get_wtime(): An OpenMP library function to get a high-resolution wall clock timer for measuring execution time.
Performance Measurement:

Use omp_get_wtime() before and after the sequential and parallel sections of your code to measure the elapsed time.
Run your experiments with different input sizes and different numbers of OpenMP threads (you can control the number of threads using omp_set_num_threads() or the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable).
Calculate the speedup (ratio of sequential execution time to parallel execution time) and efficiency (speedup divided by the number of processors/threads). Analyze how these metrics change with increasing input size and thread count.
3. Implement Min, Max, Sum, and Average Operations using Parallel Reduction
Theory:

Reduction: A common operation in parallel computing where a collection of values is combined into a single result using an associative and commutative operation (like addition, multiplication, minimum, maximum).
Parallel Reduction: The process of performing a reduction operation efficiently in parallel. A naive parallel approach of having each thread compute a partial result and then combining them sequentially can be inefficient.
OpenMP Reduction Clause:

OpenMP provides a convenient reduction clause that handles the parallel computation and combination of results efficiently.

Basic OpenMP Construct You'll Likely Use:

#pragma omp parallel for reduction(operation: variable): This directive parallelizes a loop and performs a reduction on the specified variable using the given operation.

operation can be +: sum, *: product, min: minimum, max: maximum, &: bitwise AND, |: bitwise OR, ^: bitwise XOR.
OpenMP will create private copies of the variable for each thread, perform the operation on these private copies within the parallel loop, and then combine the results using the specified operation after the loop finishes.
Implementation:

For each operation (Min, Max, Sum, Average):

Initialize a variable to hold the result (e.g., a large value for min, a small value for max, 0 for sum).
Use #pragma omp parallel for reduction(operation: result_variable) to iterate through your data (e.g., an array) and perform the reduction.
For the average, you'll need to calculate the parallel sum and then divide by the total number of elements (which can be done outside the parallel region).
4. Write a CUDA Program for:
Theory:

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture): A parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for use with their GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). GPUs have a massively parallel architecture with thousands of small, efficient cores that are well-suited for data-parallel computations.
Kernel: A function that is executed on the GPU by multiple threads in parallel.
Grid and Blocks: CUDA organizes threads into a grid of thread blocks. Each block contains multiple threads. The grid and block dimensions are configurable and determine the parallelism of your kernel.
Threads: The smallest unit of execution in CUDA. Threads within a block can cooperate using shared memory and thread synchronization.
Device Memory (GPU Memory): GPU has its own memory hierarchy, including global memory (large, slower), shared memory (fast, on-chip, shared within a block), registers (very fast, private to each thread), and constant memory (read-only, cached). Efficient use of this memory hierarchy is crucial for performance.
Host and Device: The CPU is referred to as the host, and the GPU is the device. Data needs to be transferred between host and device memory.
1. Addition of Two Large Vectors:

Concept: Each element of the resulting vector can be computed independently by a separate GPU thread.
CUDA Kernel: You'll write a kernel function that takes the two input vectors and the output vector as arguments, along with the size of the vectors.
Thread Mapping: Each thread will be responsible for computing one or more elements of the output vector based on its thread ID within the block and the block ID within the grid. A common approach is to map the i-th thread to the i-th element of the vectors.
Memory Management:
Allocate memory on the GPU for the input and output vectors using cudaMalloc().
Copy the input data from the host (CPU memory) to the device (GPU memory) using cudaMemcpy() with cudaMemcpyHostToDevice.
Launch the kernel with an appropriate grid and block configuration (<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>).
Copy the result from the device back to the host using cudaMemcpy() with cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost.
Free the allocated GPU memory using cudaFree().
2. Matrix Multiplication using CUDA C:

Concept: Matrix multiplication (C=A×B) involves computing each element C 
ij
​
  as the dot product of the i-th row of A and the j-th column of B.
CUDA Kernel: The kernel will compute a subset of the elements of the output matrix C.
Thread Mapping: A common approach is to have each thread compute one element of the output matrix C. The thread's ID can be used to determine the row and column indices (i,j) of the element it needs to compute.
Optimization (Shared Memory): To improve performance, you can utilize shared memory to cache tiles (sub-blocks) of matrices A and B that are accessed by multiple threads within a block. This reduces redundant accesses to slower global memory. The steps would involve:
Each thread block loads a tile of A and a corresponding tile of B from global memory into shared memory.
Threads within the block compute the partial products for the elements of the output tile using the cached data in shared memory.
Synchronization (__syncthreads()) is crucial to ensure that all threads in a block have loaded their data into shared memory before any thread starts using it.
After processing the tiles, the results are written to the global memory of the output matrix C.
Memory Management: Similar to vector addition, you'll need to allocate, copy data to/from the GPU, launch the kernel, and free memory.
Basic CUDA C Constructs You'll Likely Use:

__global__: Keyword to declare a kernel function that runs on the GPU.
<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>: Syntax for launching a kernel, specifying the dimensions of the grid and the blocks.
threadIdx.x, threadIdx.y, threadIdx.z: Built-in variables that give the index of the current thread within its block.
blockIdx.x, blockIdx.y, blockIdx.z: Built-in variables that give the index of the current block within the grid.
blockDim.x, blockDim.y, blockDim.z: Built-in variables that give the dimensions of the thread block.
gridDim.x, gridDim.y, gridDim.z: Built-in variables that give the dimensions of the grid.
__device__: Keyword for functions that run on the device and can be called from kernels or other device functions.
__shared__: Keyword to declare variables in shared memory within a thread block.
__syncthreads(): Barrier synchronization function that waits until all threads in the same block have reached this point.
CUDA runtime API functions: cudaMalloc(), cudaFree(), cudaMemcpy(), cudaDeviceSynchronize(), etc.
Key Considerations for CUDA:

Data Parallelism: CUDA excels at problems that can be broken down into many independent parallel tasks.
Memory Access Patterns: Efficient memory access is critical for performance on the GPU. Coalesced global memory access (where threads in a warp access contiguous memory locations) is highly desirable.
Thread Block Size and Grid Size: Choosing appropriate grid and block dimensions can significantly impact performance. Experimentation is often needed.
Host-Device Communication: Minimize data transfers between the host and device as they can be a bottleneck.
